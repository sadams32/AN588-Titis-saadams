## Scenario

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

## Notes

**Lambda**

:   the parameter of the distribution

**ppois(q, lambda)**

:   probability of getting values \<= q given lambda

**dpois(x, lambda)**

:   probability of getting a value = x given lambda

**rpois(n, lambda)**

:   simulate n random variables

**Theme Notes**

:   Cayman theme is not available in Quarto docs - flatly is supposed to be relatively close

**Commentary Notes**

:   Submitted initially without peer commentary - instead I based my edits on things I noticed I could improve when commenting on my assigned peer's code!

## Question 1

*What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?*

```{r}
1 - ppois(8, 15) # P(calls > 8) = 1 - P(calls <= 8)
```

## Question 2

*What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?*

```{r}
dpois(0, 15) # P(calls = 0)
```

## Question 3

*What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?*

```{r}
dpois(3, 15)
```

## Question 4

*Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.*

```{r}
barplot(dpois(x=0:30, lambda=15), ylim=c(0,0.15), space=0, names.arg=0:30, col = "purple", ylab="P(X=x)", xlab="x = # of Calls", main = "Probability Mass Function")
```

## Question 5

*Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).*

```{r}
set.seed(1) # seed makes sure same random numbers will be generated
simulation <- rpois(104, 15) # simulation with 104 random samples
simulation # print simulation results
summary(simulation)
```

## Question 6

*Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30.*

```{r}
hist(simulation, breaks = seq(0.5,30.5, by = 1), xlim = c(0,30), xlab = "# of Calls", ylab = "Frequency", col = "pink", main = "Histogram of Titi Call Simulution")
```

## Question 7

*How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?*

The shape of the histogram does not follow a normal distribution as closely as the probability mass function. The histogram has two distinct peaks while the probability mass function has one peak around 14-15 calls. Both shapes, however, do tail off at the upper and and lower extremes.

### 1) What you learned from running their Original Homework Code that helped improve your own code.
For finding the probability of hearing 8 or more calls I realized I did 1 - ppois(7,15) instead of 1 - ppois(8,15) - reading Carly's code made me realize I had mad this mistake and helped me understand how to work with the ppois (and other poisson functions) better. Also I realized by looking at Carly's code that I plotted frequencies of calls instead of the probability mass function. I don't know if I would have caught this mistake without seeing Carly's work!

### 2) What you did in your own code that might help to improve theirs.
I think many of my suggestions to Carly were to condense her code and omit some slightly redundant details. For example, I didn't use a separate line to define lambda for those first few questions, I did so within the functions. Also, I think I gave some good organizational tips like adding a table of contents and numbering her questions.

### 3) What challenges, if any, you both faced in your code that could not be helped by comparison.
I think Carly and I both initially struggled to find the right way to include an image in our work. It was hard to initially figure out that I should download the image and make a path within the repo, but now it seems more obvious.

### 4) Whether the annotation/commenting on your peer’s Original Homework Code is readable and interpretable to you, and if not then how it could be improved.
I thought Carly's annotation was pretty readable! I think some of it might be a little long. Shortening the annotations might make it a little more readable when returning to review the code later.
