## Scenario

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

## Notes

**Lambda**
: the parameter of the distribution

**ppois(q, lambda)**

:   probability of getting values \<= q given lambda

**dpois(x, lambda)**

:   probability of getting a value = x given lambda

**rpois(n, lambsa)**
: simulate n random variables

## Question 1

*What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?*

```{r}
1 - ppois(7, 15) # P(calls >= 8) = 1 - P(calls < 8)
```

## Question 2

*What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?*

```{r}
dpois(0, 15) # P(calls = 0)
```

## Question 3

*What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?*

```{r}
dpois(3, 15)
```

## Question 4

*Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.*

```{r}
barplot(dpois(x=0:30, lambda=15), ylim=c(0,0.15), space=0, names.arg=0:30, col = "purple", ylab="P(X=x)", xlab="# of Calls")
```

## Question 5

*Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).*

```{r}
set.seed(1) # seed makes sure same random numbers will be generated
simulation <- rpois(104, 15) # simulation with 104 random samples
simulation # print simulation results
summary(simulation)
```

## Question 6

*Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30.*
```{r}
hist(simulation, breaks = seq(0.5,30.5, by = 1), xlim = c(0,30), xlab = "# of Calls", ylab = "Frequency", col = "pink", main = "Histogram of Titi Call Simulution")
```

## Question 7

*How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?*

The shape of the histogram does not follow a normal distribution as closely as the probability mass function. The histogram has two distinct peaks while the probability mass function has one peak around 14-15 calls.
